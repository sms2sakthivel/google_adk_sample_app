SCV overview
This chapter provides an understanding of Secured Component Verification, how it is delivered, SCV features, and how it is used.Secured Component Verification
The Secured Component Verification (SCV) process is designed to ensure the authenticity and integrity of Dell products by enabling end users to perform acceptance tests and verify that their systems match their original factory configuration. This is achieved through a unique certificate, generated during factory assembly, which contains system component IDs that are used for validation.
The SCV application uses this certificate to validate the current system inventory and generate a detailed validation report, highlighting any matches or mismatches. Also, the SCV application performs rigorous cryptographic validations to verify the genuineness of the server, including:
* Platform certificate signature validation
* Root of Trust validation
* Possession of the private key validation
The SCV application generates a validation report detailing the inventory matches and mismatches against the SCV certificate. It also verifies the certificate and Chain of Trust along with the Proof of Possession of the SCV Private key.SCV process overview
The SCV process ensures the authenticity and integrity of server components through the following six key stages:

Table 1. SCV process overview
STAGE	DESCRIPTION
Order	The customer places an order for a server.
Build	The order is received at the Dell Technologies factory, where the server is
              manufactured.
Collect	Component and firmware data are gathered during the build process.
Store	Certificates are signed using a Hardware Security Module (HSM), encrypted, and
              securely stored in the server iDRAC crypto vault.
Deliver	The completed server is shipped to the customer.
Validate	After delivery, the customer verifies the authenticity of the server components
              using the stored cryptographic certificate data.

Features of SCV
* Firmware certificate feature is available starting from SCV version 2.1.0 and later, firmware certificates provide an added layer of security, verifying the authenticity and integrity of the firmware.
* SCV supports both in-band and out-of-band modes for flexible deployment. In-band certificate extraction requires root or sudo access, while out-of-band methods work without elevated privileges, enabling easier integration in restricted environments.
* The support for Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0 indicates that SCV can leverage the advanced security features that are provided by TPM 2.0.Key guidelines and recommendations
* To ensure smooth operation and accurate validation using the Secured Component Verification (SCV) application, follow these essential guidelines:

*         
*           
*             
* License Requirement
*             
* Purchase an SCV license for each server at the time of order.
*           
*           
*             
* Initial Testing

*               allowed before this test.
*           
*           
*             
* Hardware/Firmware Changes
*             
* Avoid changes before acceptance testing. If changes were made, revert them before
*               running SCV.
*           
*           
*             
* TPM Requirement

*           
*             
* iDRAC USB Ports
*             
* All internal/external iDRAC USB ports must be enabled.
*           
*           
*             
* Drive Status in iDRAC
*             
* Do not remove drives from iDRAC before SCV validation.
*           
*           
*             
* FlexAddress (Modular Systems)

*             
* GPU Removal
*             
* May show “Unknown” in mismatch summary.
*           
*           
*             
* Unknown Values in Reports
*             
* These indicate missing hardware properties, not security issues. Safe to
*               ignore.

View the SCV logs in Linux
About this task
To view the SCV logs in Linux, follow the below steps:
Steps
1. Locate the SCV logs stored in the directory: /var/tmp/<username>/scvapp/logs. Replace <username> with the actual username of the user who ran the SCV command.
2. Navigate to the logs folder using the command: cd /var/tmp/<username>/scvapp/logs.
Use the command vi SCVLog_<service-tag>_<timestamp>.log to view the logs. Replace <service-tag> with the actual service tag of the system. Replace <timestamp> with the actual timestamp of the log file. For example: vi SCVLog_RtSTC21_2020_09_15_05_55_28.log

Installation and operations for SCV on Windows Server 2019, 2022, and 2025

Install SCV on Windows Server 2019, 2022, and 2025
Prerequisites
Download the SCV application.
About this task
You must have root privileges or use sudo to complete the installation on a Windows system. To install SCV on Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server 2025, follow the below steps:
Steps
1. Extract the contents of Dell-SCVTools-Web-Web-LX-X.X.X-XXX_XXX.zip to a folder on your local.
2. Locate the extracted application (it should be an executable file) and run it to start the InstallShield Wizard. This wizard guides you through the installation process.
3. Click Next, then accept the License Agreement. You will go to the installation step. The default installation path is set to C:\ProgramFiles\Dell\SCVTools and cannot be customized.

Run SCV on Windows Server 2019, 2022, and 2025
About this task
To run the SCV on Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server 2025, follow the below steps:
Steps
1. Run the scv validatesysteminventory command to start the validation process.
    * If you encounter the error 'Downloading SCV Factory Certificate: Fail' while the host firewall is enabled, create an outbound rule for the IP address to run the command successfully.
    * After obtaining the 'Ready' status in the racadm getremoteservicesstatus output, wait for about 120 s before running the SCV commands.
2. If the result shows Inventory Comparison Result : Match, it means the system's components match those expected according to the SCV certificate. scv validatesysteminventory

SCV Root CA Certificate
The root certificate is available for customers to manually verify that the signature of an SCV platform certificate was created by a Dell factory that is trusted by the root. While our SCV application automatically performs this verification, the root certificate is provided for other scenarios where customers may need to verify the root directly.
